#Course Project ReadMe
---------------------------
run_analysis.R is the R script used to load and create the AvgMeanStdBySubjectActivity.txt output.

The output of the script has also been included: AvgMeanStdBySubjectActivity.txt

The data for the project was downloaded from this URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
That zip file contains a README.txt file that describes the data in detail.

The CodeBook.md file describes how the data was downloaded, manipulated, and transformed. 
It also provides a description of the variables in the tidy data set in AvgMeanStdBySubjectActivity.txt.
